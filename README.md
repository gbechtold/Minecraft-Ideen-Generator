# Minecraft Idea Generator

A fun slot machine style generator that creates random Minecraft build ideas by combining different contexts, themes, and building types.


## Features

- 🎮 **Slot Machine Interface**: Pull the lever or click a button to generate new ideas
- 🎯 **Randomized Results**: Combines from 30 different contexts, themes, and building types
- 🎉 **Surprise Jackpots**: Random chance for special "super idea" animations
- 🌈 **Visual Effects**: Animations and visual feedback make idea generation fun
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

The generator randomly selects one item from each of these three categories:

1. **Context**: Where your build will be located (Survival, Ocean, Nether, etc.)
2. **Theme/Material**: The primary material or theme for your build (Redstone, Water, Wool, etc.)
3. **Building Type**: The type of construction to create (Farm, Castle, Tower, etc.)

These three elements combine to give you a unique building challenge, such as:
"Build in 🌊 Ocean a 💎 Diamond-based 🏰 Castle construction!"
